## 🎯 Business Objective

E-commerce marketplaces often struggle with low repeat purchase rates.  
This dashboard highlights the operational and behavioural drivers behind customer retention and identifies opportunities to increase repeat revenue.

The goal is to transform raw SQL analysis into an **executive-level decision tool**.

---

## 📈 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides a high-level snapshot of marketplace performance, including:

- Total revenue and order volume  
- Average order value and purchase frequency  
- Percentage of repeat customers  
- Operational and behavioural drivers of retention  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1️⃣ Repeat customers are extremely rare
Only **3.1% of customers** place a second order.  
This highlights a major retention opportunity for the marketplace.

Despite a large customer base, the business is heavily dependent on one-time buyers.

---

### 2️⃣ Delivery performance directly impacts retention
Late deliveries are associated with higher customer loss, resulting in approximately **3,000 customers lost** due to delivery issues.

Improving delivery reliability represents a clear and actionable retention lever.

---

### 3️⃣ Repeat customers are far more valuable
Repeat customers generate only **5.9% of total revenue**, yet they spend **~2× more per customer** than one-time buyers.

Even small improvements in retention could significantly increase long-term revenue.

---

### 4️⃣ First-order spend does not drive repeat purchases
Customers who spend more on their first purchase are **not more likely to return**.

This suggests that discounts or higher initial basket value do not create long-term loyalty on their own.

Retention must be driven by **experience and operations**, not acquisition spend.

---

### 5️⃣ Product categories influence repeat behaviour
Repeat purchase rates vary significantly across product categories.

This insight provides direction for:
- Targeted marketing campaigns  
- Category prioritisation  
- Retention-focused promotions
